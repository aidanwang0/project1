## Time Investment

### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?

- Number of hours: [n hours]

### How many additional test cases did you write to test your implementation?

- Number of test cases: [n tests]

### If you used other people's test cases, acknowledge the authors below.

- Vincent Etherton, addioverflow.s
- Stefan Gjaja, slli.s

## Challenges Encountered

### Did you encounter any serious problems? If yes, please describe (e.g spec was unclear).

- No

## Additional Comments

### Write any other comments here.

- It was very time consuming to write our own test cases to make sure all 49 instructions were working correctly,
opposed to having a test case suite that we can run ourselves to quickly check where our errors were.
